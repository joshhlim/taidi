"""The room/round state machine.

Two halves, kept deliberately separate so an API layer can persist an event
before applying it:

- command functions (`join_player`, `start_game`, `claim_win`, ...) are the
  *validate* step: given the current state, they either return the event(s)
  the command produces, or raise a MachineError. They never mutate state.
- `apply(state, event) -> state` is the single source of truth for how one
  event changes state. Replaying a room's whole event log through `apply`
  (via `fold`) must reproduce the same RoomState `dispatch`ing live would.

A command can produce more than one event: submitting the last outstanding
card count for a round also emits a system `round_resolved` event in the
same call, so callers always get a flat, already-ordered event list to
persist and apply.

Design notes:
- Every mutating command takes `expected_seq`; a mismatch raises SeqConflict
  so the caller can show "here's what actually happened" instead of merging.
- Nothing is ever deleted. Voiding a round resets it to `playing` rather than
  marking a terminal "voided" phase — the `round_voided` event itself is the
  permanent audit record; RoomState only ever reflects the current attempt.
- Special hands settle immediately (independent of the round they occur in);
  card-based transfers settle only when every loser's count is in.
