"""The Mahjong room/hand state machine.

Mirrors taidi_core/machine.py's split (command functions validate and
return events; apply() is the sole source of truth for state mutation) but
for Mahjong's shape: no round-based collecting phase — YAO/GANG never close
a hand, only HU/NO_WIN do, and closing a hand also runs dealer/wind
advancement.

Design notes:
- Seats are fixed 0-3 slots, defaulting to join order; the host can
  rearrange them with assign_seats before starting.
- Dealer/wind rule (confirmed with the product owner — not standard
  mahjong): outside the last seat of the last wind, a hand with any GANG
  rotates the dealer to the next seat (wrapping seat 3->0 advances the
  wind); a hand with no GANG repeats the same dealer. The last seat of the
  last wind is different: it only closes the wind cycle on a WIN — a
  no-win hand there just repeats, regardless of GANGs. Cycle completion
  sets pending_wind_decision; only the host's continue_wind or end_game can
  proceed from there.
- Closing a hand (HU or NO_WIN) computes the dealer/wind outcome up front
  (`_plan_hand_close`) and folds it into the event payload, so apply() never
  recomputes it — replay stays exact even if the rule itself changes later
  (old events keep the outcome they were closed with).
