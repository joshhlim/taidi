"""Typed vocabulary for mahjong_core: rules, hands, transfers, rooms, events.

Mirrors taidi_core/models.py's conventions (integer cents, frozen rule
models, event-sourced RoomState) but for Mahjong's very different shape:
no round-based card-count collection — a continuous stream of YAO/GANG/HU
declarations against an always-open hand, plus dealer/wind bookkeeping
Taidi has no equivalent of. See ADR-0006 for why this is a separate
package rather than a taidi_core extension.

Genuinely game-agnostic types (Member, Settlement, PlayerStats, RoomStatus,
the MachineError hierarchy) are imported from taidi_core rather than
duplicated here — see __init__.py.

Seats are plain ints 0-3, defaulting to join order; the host can rearrange
them via machine.assign_seats before starting. The 東南西北 nicknames are a
frontend display concern only — the backend never needs to know them.
