"""Persistence for Taidi Tracker.

Two backends, picked automatically per connection:
- Local SQLite file (taidi.db next to the app) — the default for development.
- Turso (hosted libSQL) — used when TURSO_DATABASE_URL is present in
  Streamlit secrets or the environment, so data survives cloud redeploys.

Both speak the same SQL; rows are accessed positionally so the two drivers
behave identically.
